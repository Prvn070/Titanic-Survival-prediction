# Titanic Survival Prediction

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using machine learning techniques. The dataset used for this analysis is the famous Titanic dataset, which includes information such as passenger class, sex, age, fare, and other relevant attributes.

## Dataset
The dataset contains the following key features:
- **PassengerId**: Unique identifier for each passenger.
- **Pclass**: Passenger class (1st, 2nd, or 3rd).
- **Name**: Name of the passenger.
- **Sex**: Gender of the passenger.
- **Age**: Age of the passenger.
- **SibSp**: Number of siblings/spouses aboard.
- **Parch**: Number of parents/children aboard.
- **Ticket**: Ticket number.
- **Fare**: Fare paid for the ticket.
- **Cabin**: Cabin number (if available).
- **Embarked**: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton).
- **Survived**: Target variable (0 = Did not survive, 1 = Survived).

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handling missing values.
   - Converting categorical variables into numerical representations.
   - Feature selection and engineering.
2. **Model Training & Evaluation**:
   - Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
   - Training machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, XGBoost).
   - Evaluating model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
   - Optimizing model performance through hyperparameter tuning.
4. **Predictions & Insights**:
   - Making predictions on unseen data.
   - Interpreting the results and extracting insights.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, XGBoost
- **Jupyter Notebook** for development and analysis

## Installation & Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/titanic-survival-prediction.git
   cd titanic-survival-prediction
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
4. Open and execute the notebook `titanic_survival.ipynb`.

## Results
The best-performing model achieved an accuracy of approximately **XX%** on the test set. Insights derived from the analysis:
- Women had a significantly higher survival rate than men.
- Passengers in first class had better chances of survival.
- Younger passengers had a higher survival rate compared to older passengers.

## Future Improvements
- Implementing deep learning models for better accuracy.
- Performing more feature engineering to extract meaningful insights.
- Enhancing hyperparameter tuning for optimized performance.
